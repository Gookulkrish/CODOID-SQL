2.Joins
	  The process of Retriviy data from multiple table simulatously is knows joins.
		CARTESION JOINS/CROSS JOIN :
		In cartesion join record from table 1 will merge with all the records of table 2 and so on.
		Number of column in the result table will be equal to the columns present in both the table.
		Number of records in the result table will be equal to the products of records of both table.
			Example:
			SELECT  Student.NAME, Student.AGE, StudentCourse.COURSE_ID
			FROM Student CROSS JOIN StudentCourse;
		INNER JOIN:
		Its is used to obtain the matching record or the records which are having a pair.
		in Inner join the condition should be column from tble 1 should be matched with column from table 2.
			Example:
			   Select *
			   From emp inner join dept 
			   On emp.deptno in dept.deptno;
		NATURAL JOIN :
		 It has 2 behaviour.
		1. It acts as inner join when we have a relation between the 2 tables.
		2. When there is no relation between the table It acts as cartision join.
			Example : 
			select *
			From emp natural join dept;
		OUTER JOIN:
		It is used to obtain unmatched records.
			1. Left outer join
				 It is used to obtain unmatching record from the left table along with matching record.
				 Example:
				    Select *
				    From emp left join dept
				    On emp.dept.no in dept.deptno;
			 2. Right outer join
				It is used to obtain unmatching record from right table along with matching record.
				  Example:
				    Select ename,dname
				    From emp,right outer join dept
				    On emp.deptno in dept.deptno;
			 3. Full outer join
			    It is used to obtain unmatching record from both table along with matching record.
				Example:
				Select *
				From emp full join dept
				On emp.deptno in deptno;
			 4.Self join 
			   Joining the same two table (or)
			   Joining table by itself is known as self join.
				Example:
				Select *
				From emp E1 join emp E2
				On E1.MGR IN E2.empno;

3.Rename
	 Rename student to stddetails;

4.Duplicate Records
	Select distinct job
	From emp;

5.Distinct
	Its is used to remove the duplicate as repeated value from the table.
	Distinct clause should be always used as a first argument in the select clause.
	We can pass multiple arguments in the distinct clause , it removes if the combination of column are replaced or duplicate. 
	Example :
	Select distinct per
	From Students;
7.Max Salary
	Select max(sal)
	From emp
	Where job dept in 'Tester';
8.Operator 
	  Arithmetic operator(+,-,*,/)
	  Relational operators (>,>=,<,<=)
	  Comparitional operator(=,!=(<>))
	  Concadination operator(||)
	  Logical operator
		     AND 
		     OR
		     NOT
	   Special operator
		      IN
		      NOT IN
		      BETWEEN
		      NOT BETWEEN
		      IS
		      IS NOT
		      LIKE
		      NOT LIKE
	  Sub query operator
		    ALL
		    ANY
		    EXISTS
		    NOT EXISTS
9. First 5 Records in tables
	Select * from EMP 
	LIMIT 5;
10. Last 5 Records in tables
	SELECT * FROM
        (SELECT TOP 5 *
	FROM Emp
        ORDER BY ID DESC)
	ORDER BY id ASC;
12.Create Table
	CREATE TABLE adminUsers SELECT * FROM users;
